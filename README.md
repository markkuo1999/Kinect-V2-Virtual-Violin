# Kinect-V2-Virtual-Violin
With motion capture technique of Kinect V2, the device can detect human joint. I made an interface with WPF using C# to interact with Kinect V2. Kinect V2 traces user's left hand joint so as to choose different notes of violin, and by waving right arm, Kinect V2 can detect the movement like playing the bow of violin. Users can also choose different instrument like string ensemble, cello and double bass.
